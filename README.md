# Game-of-Life-Project
A project started when I was an undergrad at York Univerisity. This project recreates "The Game of Life" by John Horton Conway

This project aimed to simulate bacteria in a petri dish. You can click and drag your curser across the screen to interact with the cellular automata.

The offical upload of the code can be view on the "CodePen" website:
